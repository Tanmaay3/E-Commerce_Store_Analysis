This dataset contains actual transactions for a UK based e-commerce store from 2010 and 2011. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. Our aim is to analyze the transactions made from the dataset. From the analysis, we will develop a model to segment customers into groups, based on their common characteristics and past purchase behavior.
